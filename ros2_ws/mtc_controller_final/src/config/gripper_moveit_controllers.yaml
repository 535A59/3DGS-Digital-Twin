# MoveIt2 Controllers Configuration
# ================================
#
# This file defines the controllers that MoveIt2 will use to send commands
# to the robot's hardware drivers (in our case, the franka_moveit_bridge).
#
# Each controller has a name (e.g., panda_arm_controller) which must match
# the name used in your SRDF and kinematics configuration.
#

controller_names:
  - panda_arm_controller
  - panda_hand_controller

# Configuration for the ARM controller
# ====================================
panda_arm_controller:
  type: FollowJointTrajectory # Specifies that this controller uses the FollowJointTrajectory action interface.
  action_ns: follow_joint_trajectory # The namespace for the action. MoveIt will publish to /panda_arm_controller/follow_joint_trajectory.
  default: true # This makes it the default controller for the arm group.
  joints:
    - panda_joint1
    - panda_joint2
    - panda_joint3
    - panda_joint4
    - panda_joint5
    - panda_joint6
    - panda_joint7

# Configuration for the HAND (Gripper) controller
# ===============================================
panda_hand_controller:
  type: GripperCommand # Specifies that this controller uses the GripperCommand action interface.
  action_ns: gripper_cmd # The namespace for the action. MoveIt will publish to /panda_hand_controller/gripper_cmd.
  default: true # This makes it the default controller for the hand group.
  joints:
    - panda_finger_joint1 # The joint(s) that this controller commands. For the Franka gripper, it's often represented by one or two finger joints.
    # - panda_finger_joint2 # Uncomment if your URDF/SRDF uses two joints for the gripper.
